    <p>Our website represents a 'Distribution system' where an administrator<br/>
        can offer products and a customer can buy them.</p>
    An admin can login so that he/she can control the products, which can be sold to customer, the actual orders and
    payments<br>
    from the customers and full control over their accounts. A customer can login so that she/he can order different
    products,</br>
    control his/her orders or payments methods and also have full control over his/her account.</p>
    <p>However, our program is small - we should admit that there is load of work which should be done in order to have
        a fully<br/>
        working distribution system. We believe that this is good enough to what we have learnt during our last semester
